Version 1.0.0
## Description
Buying and selling stocks is very easy now days but the crutch is having the time to do the analysis of many variables that determines if the stock price goes up and down. The goal is to create a program the uses key variables that are both general and specific to a stock, John Deere in this case, to determine a strategy. We will also use Duke Energy Stock and potential Wells Fargo.
## Data
Data is grouped into two categories. General data that can be used on any stock and more specific variables related to that stock.
General- common to all stocks
* Key market indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, VIX)
o Yahoo.com API for ticker data.

We will use https://polygon.io/ to get data from the API for Duke Energy and Wells Fargo ticker stock. We have to determine if we can get history.
* Market sentiment based on news articles to determine near term market trend
o Wallstreet Journal for correlation of news and stock performance. We can pull data from https://newsapi.org/ and do basic etl categorizing the news articals as positive or negative. We can store these results into a mongo DB.  
* Fibonacci Cycles Specific ï¿½ individual or category of stocks
* Commodity prices that drive purchase of farm equipment (corn, soybeans)
* Company specific sentiment based on news articles for near term market trend
## Methods
